# Advent of Code Week 4 Repository

This repo includes code and documentation solutions for the AoC Week 4 challenges. This repository demonstrates some of my programming and documentation capabilities.
It includes the following components:
  - A C# solution and project.
  - A DocFx solution that processed Markdown files and auto-generated documentation from code comments.
  - GitHub pages support to publish this to a website.
