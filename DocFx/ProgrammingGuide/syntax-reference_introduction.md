# Syntax Reference Introduction

The Syntax Reference section includes auto-generated API documentation of commands used in the Advent of Code puzzle solutions. These API pages are generated through XML-tagged comments within the code structure, which DocFX is able to interpret and publish without manual input.

All code in this section exists under the namespace Week4. This namespace includes objects that each have their own documented properties and methods.

You can find the namespace page [here](../reference/Week4.yml).
